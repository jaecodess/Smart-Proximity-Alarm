## Smart Proximity Alarm

This project aims to build a smart proximity alarm using a Raspberry Pi 400 controlled by a ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor will detect the distance to an obstacle,
and different sounds will be played depending on how far the object is. Python will mainly be used to program the system’s behaviour.
